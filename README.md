  ## Description
  
  ReadMeGenerator is a streamlined command-line tool that simplifies the creation of professional README files for software projects. Utilizing Node.js and the Inquirer package, it prompts users through a series of questions to automatically generate a detailed README, covering essential aspects like installation, usage, contributions, testing, and licensing. This tool helps developers save time and focus on development, ensuring their projects are well-documented and easily understandable.

  ## Installation
  
  First need to initialize the repository with a package.json file by running ‘npm init -y’ from terminal. Then need to install inquirer version 8.2.4 and add it to the list of dependencies by running ‘npm install inquirer@8.2.4’ from terminal. Finally, execute the command `node index.js` to have the questions appear in the terminal.
